# simplebayes

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of simplebayes is to allow the user to perform simple tasks in Bayesian statistics without requiring him or her to learn how to use a complex package such as Stan. This will allow the user to focus on the results of the model being built instead of how to build the model itself.

## Installation

You can install the development version of simplebayes from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kevgre/simplebayes")
```

## Example

A common task in Bayesian statistics is to find the probability of a certain value in the posterior distribution given a binomial likelihood. The first step is to choose a prior. For a binomial likelihood, a common choice of prior is the beta distribution. With this, the posterior can be found as follows given some data:

```{r example}
library(simplebayes)
successes <- 20
sample_size <- 100

pbeta_post(0.3, successes, sample_size, likelihood = "binom")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
